# OCI Vocabulary Specification

## Draft Vocabulary for US DSCSA ATP Credentialing

This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting enterprise identity verification and ATP license status of dispensenrs, wholesalers and manufacturers used to verify a counterparty enterprise identity and to determine the ATP licenses of supply chain actors.

## US DSCSA requirements

Under DSCSA regulations, trading partners must fulfill requirements to trace and validate suspicious or returned products along the supply chain. The required data exchange between trading partners occurs on a peer-to-peer basis by using electronic systems. Any trading partner that is interacting in a product verification or tracing operation must be “authorized” as defined under FD&C Act 581(2).

Today, either an ATP has an existing relationship of trust with their direct trading partner, or manual steps are implemented to establish trust to indirect trading partners. To manually establish a trusted affiliation with an indirect trading partner, an ATP needs to collect records of the trading partner´s business registration, license status, or requires onboarding questionnaires. This manual process can take days, weeks, or in some cases, months. As a result of the existing system, it will be impossible to assure DSCSA compliance when thousands of indirect trading partners are needed to verify products and expect a response within 24h.
By enabling a digital verification in real time, Spherity helps avoid manual processes that drive personal costs.

## Related Project: ATP Credentialing Pilot

To create a solution meeting the US DSCSA requirement for authorized trading partners, an industry project was formed in 2020 together with global pharmaceutical trading partners and service providers, and developed an industry wide pilot project. The ATP credentialing pilot was supported by the Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) and managed by the Center for Supply Chain Studies. Within this industry-wide pilot, Verifiable Credential based ecosystem forming a solution for Authorized Trading Partner authentication in saleable returns and suspicious product verifications was established. 

## Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)

The Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) is built upon open standards to enable the adoption of the interoperable W3C Verifiable Credential standard. All implementations incubated by the OCI need to fulfill the standard requirements in order to ensure interoperability across vendors. Together with early adopters of the ATP architecture, the Open Credentialing Initiative will incubate the piloted ATP architecture to further standardize the implementation for a large-scale adoption. The members are jointly working on technical specifications, education materials and drive standardization requirements across the industry.

## OCI Credential Schemas and Linked Data Vocabulary

Ecosystem adoption will be supported by open semantic standards in form of this linked data vocabulary that is developed and agreed upon by the US pharma supply chain industry. We encourage contributions meeting OCI's inclusive collaboration principles.
