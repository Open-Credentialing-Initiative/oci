    In the United States, wholesale distributors are required to verify the 
    serial number on "saleable returns" via a request to the respective manufacturer, 
    before selling the product back into the supply chain. In this context, it must 
    be ensured that both parties, wholesale distributor and manufacturer, are clearly 
    identified as Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) by verifying their ATP license status. 
    Similar ATP requirements are imposed on dispensers for "suspicious product verification" 
    and the corresponding product identifier (PI) verification process.
    
    Then Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) have come together to support the industry-wide
    implementation of the architecture demonstrated in the ATP Proof of Concept and Pilot 
    conducted in 2020. This architecture supports the ATP requirements of the Drug Supply
    Chain Security Act (DSCSA) and employs the use if W3C standard Decentralized Identifiers,
    Verifiable Credentials, Verifiable Presentations, Credential Revocation Registries
    and the necessary processes and information exchanges between DSCSA defined
    Trading Partners to establish mutual verification of identity and ATP status. 
    
    This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting
    enterprise identity verification and ATP license status of dispensenrs, wholesalers and
    manufacturers used to verify a counterparty enterprise identity and to determine the
    ATP licenses of supply chain actors.
